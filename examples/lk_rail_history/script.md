Henry Charles Beck (also known as Harry Beck), was an English technical draughtsman who created the first diagrammatic London Underground Tube map in 1931.

The Design has since been referred to as the Harry Beck Map, and has been copied to represent many transport systems across the world.

In this video, we use Harry Beck diagrams to describe the various stages in the history of Sri Lanka's Railway system.

The first segment of the Main line, from Colombo to Ambepussa, was the first rail line in Sri Lanka.

It was officially opened for traffic on 2 October 1865.

The main reason for building a railway system in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) was to transport tea and coffee from the hill country to Colombo.

The Main Line was extended in stages with service to the hill capital Kandy beginning in 1867 via Peradeniya.

From Gampola to Nawalapitiya in 1874.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1875.png)

And from Nawalapitiya to Talawakele in 1875.

The Coastal Line (sometimes referred to as the Coast Line or Southern Line) was the second railway line in Sri Lanka. On 1 March 1877, the first train up to Panadura commenced.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1878.png)

By 1 February 1878, the line was extended from Panadura to Kalutara.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1879.png)

On 1 February 1879, the Costal Line was extended from Kalutara to Wadduwa.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1880.png)

The Matale line (sometimes referred to as the Kandy line) branches off the Main Line, and was inaugurated in 1880.

The 28.2 km route was surveyed between 1875 and 1877. In May 1878 the contract to construct the rail line was issued to David Reid for Rs. 1,782,408. The total estimated cost of the Matale extension amounted to Rs. 3,300,000, being a rate of Rs. 189,247 per mile.

The line was opened for traffic on 4 October 1880 by the Governor, Sir James Longden, eight months earlier than the contract date, for which Reid was given a Rs. 35,000 bonus.

In 1885, the Main Line was extended to Nanu Oya.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1890.png)

On 31 March 1890, the Costal Line was extended from Wadduwa to Aluthgama.

And from Kosgoda to Ambalangoda on 15 November 1893.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1894.png)

There were three important developments to the Railway Network in 1894.

First, a new line connecting Polgahawela on the Main Line to Kurunegala opened on 14 February 1894. This new line would later become the Northern Line.

Second, on 7 May 1894 the Coastal Line was extended to Galle.

And finally, the Main Line was extended from Nanu Oya to Bandarawela.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1899.png)

In 1899, the Northern Line was extended from Kurunegala to Maho.

Tenders for the construction of railway line from Maho to Kankesanthurai were called in January 1900 and construction of the new line started in April of that year.

Construction of the Kankesanthurai-Pallai section, including Jaffna, began in July 1900.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1902.png)

This section was officially opened by Governor Sir J. W. Ridgeway on 11 March 1902.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1903.png)

1903 saw two new lines commencing service.

First, the Kelani Valley line, connecting Maradana on the Main line, and Yatiyantota commenced service. The line primarily served rubber plantations in the area.

Then on 14 December 1903, the Uda Pussellawa Railway (or UPR), connecting Nanu Oya on the Main Line and Nuwara Eliya, also commenced service.

By 21 December 1903, the UPR was extended from Nuwara Eliya to Kandapola.

In July 1904, the Uda Pussellawa Railway was extended from Kandapola to Ragala.

Then on 1 November 1904, the Northern Line was extended from Maho to Anuradhapura.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1905.png)

On 11 March 1905, the Northern Line was extended from Anuradhapura to Medawachchiya, and on 1 August 1905 from Medawachchiya to Pallai, finally connecting the national capital Colombo with Jaffna, the capital of the Northern Province.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1914.png)

The Mannar Line, a new line branching off Medawachchiya on the Northern Line, and connecting to Talaimannar Pier, opened in 1914.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1915.png)

The Puttalam Line was extended from Negombo to Madampe in 1915.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1916.png)

And then from Madampe to Chilaw in 1916.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1924.png)

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1943.png)

In 1943 the track from Bangadeniya to Puttalam was removed, as the rails were required on other strategically important routes due to shortages caused by World War II.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1946.png)

It was re-laid in 1946 with a number of new stations added to the line. The line was also extended beyond Puttalam to Periyanagavillu.

By January 1940, all passenger services on the Uda Pussellawa Line were withdrawn and only two freight trains were in operation between Nanu Oya and Ragala.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1948.png)

On 2 August 1948 all services were withdrawn and the line was completely removed.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1970.png)

In 1970, a short branch line connecting Katunayake South on the Puttalam Line and Katunayake International Airport commenced service.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1973.png)

The Kelani Valley line segment from Homagama to Opanayaka was closed in 1973.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1978.png)

The services were restarted from Homagama to Avissawella in 1978.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1985.png)

Due to the Civil war, the Mannar line was closed in 1985.

With further escalation of the Civil War, trains, especially the Yaal Devi service (from Colombo to Kankesanturai), became the target of frequent LTTE attacks.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1990.png)

After multiple attacks, service between Vavuniya and Kankesanturai was suspended in 1990.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1993.png)

A new, 11 km branch line from Anuradhapura on the Northern Line, to Mihintale was opened in 1993. The line primarily transported Buddhist pilgrims traveling to the sacred sites at Mihintale

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/1996.png)

With continued escalation of the Civil War in the Eastern Province, the segment from Polonnaruwa to Batticaloa on the Batticaloa Line was closed on 31 October 1996.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/2003.png)

It was reopened on 12 April 2003.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/2011.png)

After the end of the Civil War in 2009, the Northern Line was reopened in stages. The segment from Vavuniya to Omanthai was reopened on 27 May 2011.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/2013.png)

The segment from Omanthai to Pallai opened in 2013.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/2015.png)

And finally from Jaffna to Kankesanthurai on 2 January 2015.

The remainder of the Mannar Line was also reopened from Madhu Road to Talaimannar Pier on 14 September 2015.

![image](examples/lk_rail_history/images/2019.png)

The Coastal Line was extended from Matara to Beliatta on 8 April 2019.

Various plans have been proposed to extend the Railway Network in Sri Lanka, including an extension of the Coastal Line to Kataragama via Hambantota, and to reopen the Kelani Valley Line from Avissawella to Opanayaka.

But these plans are yet to be realized.

Thank's for watching.
