# Singapore - Paradoxes

## High Regulation

Despite its reputation for economic freedom and low taxation, Singapore has significant government intervention in key sectors such as housing, health care, and education. The government actively engages in industrial policy and provides substantial support to selected industries.

## Public Housing Dominance

Around 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing provided by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). This system is well-maintained and highly sought after, contrasting with the often negative connotations of public housing in other countries.

## Authoritarian Yet Popular

Singapore's political system is often described as authoritarian, yet it enjoys a high level of public satisfaction and trust in government. This is partly due to the government's effective delivery of public services and the perception of low corruption.

## Socialist Policies in a Capitalist Economy

Singapore blends capitalist economic policies with socialist welfare systems. For instance, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a comprehensive social security savings plan funded by contributions from both employers and employees, used for retirement, health care, and housing.

## Multicultural but Strict on Speech

Singapore is known for its multicultural society, promoting racial and religious harmony. However, it also has strict laws regulating speech to prevent any statements that could incite racial or religious discord, which can seem contradictory to the idea of free speech in multicultural settings.

## High Cost of Living with Low Inequality

Despite being one of the world's most expensive cities, Singapore has managed to keep income inequality relatively low. This is achieved through progressive taxation, targeted social programs, and subsidies for education and health care.

## Innovation with Caution

While Singapore is a global hub for innovation and technology, it adopts a cautious approach towards disruptive technologies. The government often conducts extensive studies and pilots before fully implementing new technologies, ensuring that changes align with social and economic goals.

## Strict Laws and Low Crime

The city-state is known for its strict laws and enforcement, contributing to its low crime rates. However, this strictness also extends to areas such as chewing gum regulations, where the sale and import of chewing gum are heavily restricted to maintain cleanliness.

## Bilingual Education System

Singapore's education system mandates that students learn both English and their mother tongue (Chinese, Malay, or Tamil), promoting bilingualism. This policy has been crucial in maintaining cultural heritage while ensuring global competitiveness through English proficiency.

## High GDP with Modest Social Spending

Despite having one of the highest GDPs per capita, Singapore's government maintains relatively modest direct social spending compared to other developed nations, relying instead on policies that promote self-reliance and individual savings.
